This is therefore intended to be an accessible, introductory overview of the torus with some emphasis on the solid-state spectral features observed.}

    abstract = "{Astrophysical jets reveal strong signs of radial structure. They suggest that the inner region of the jet, the jet spine, consists of a low-density, fast-moving gas, while the outer region of the jet consists of a more dense and slower moving gas, called the jet sheath. Moreover, if jets carry angular momentum, the resultant centrifugal forces lead to a radial stratification. Current observations are not able to fully resolve the radial structure, so little is known about its actual profile. We present three active galactic nuclei jet models in 2.5D of which two have been given a radial structure. The first model is a homogeneous jet, the only model that does not carry angular momentum; the second model is a spine–sheath jet with an isothermal equation of state; and the third jet model is a (piecewise) isochoric spine–sheath jet, with constant but different densities for jet spine and jet sheath. In this paper, we look at the effects of radial stratification on jet integrity, mixing between the different jet components and global morphology of the jet-head and surrounding cocoon. We consider steady jets that have been active for 23 Myr. All jets have developed the same number of strong internal shocks along their jet axis at the final time of simulation. These shocks arise when vortices are being shed by the jet-head. We find that all three jets maintain their stability all the way up to the jet-head. The isothermal jet maintains part of its structural integrity at the jet-head where the distinction between jet spine and jet sheath material can still be made. In this case, mixing between jet spine and jet sheath within the jet is fairly inefficient. The isochoric jet, on the other hand, loses its structural jet integrity fairly quickly after the jet is injected. At its jet-head, little structure is maintained and the central part of the jet predominantly consists of jet sheath material. In this case, jet spine and jet sheath material mix efficiently within the jet. We find that the propagation speed for all three models is less than expected from simple theoretical predictions. We propose this is due to an enlarged cross-section of the jet which impacts with the ambient medium. We show that in these models, the effective surface area is 16 times as large in the case of the homogeneous jet, 30 times as large in the case of the isochoric jet and can be up to 40 times as large in the case of the isothermal jet.}",

Combining the accretion rates with the bolometric luminosity, we obtained the accretion efficiency. We found that most Seyfert 1 galaxies and radio-quiet quasars have lower accretion efficiencies, while most radio-loud quasars possess higher accretion efficiencies. This finding further implies that most of the radio-loud quasars possess Kerr black holes, while Seyfert 1 galaxies and radio-quiet quasars may not possess Kerr black holes. Considering the difference in the accretion efficiency, we found that there is a strong correlation between the accretion rate in units of the Eddington accretion rate and the width of the $\\mathrm\\{H\\}\\beta\\$ emission line, and that most AGNs are not accreting at super-Eddington rates.}",

title = {Propagation of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays},
journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {We briefly describe the energy loss processes of ultrahigh-energy protons, heavier nuclei and γ-rays in interactions with the universal photon fields of the Universe. We then discuss the modification of the accelerated cosmic-ray energy spectrum in propagation by the energy loss processes and the charged cosmic-ray scattering in the extragalactic magnetic fields. The energy lost by the ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays goes into γ-rays and neutrinos that carry additional information about the sources of highest energy particles. The new experimental results of the HiRes and the Auger collaborations are discussed in view of the predictions from propagation calculations.}

    abstract = "{The accretion efficiency for individual black holes is very difficult to determine accurately. There are many factors that can influence each step of the calculation, such as the dust and host galaxy contribution to the observed luminosity, the black hole mass and more importantly the uncertainties on the bolometric luminosity measurement. Ideally, we would measure the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) emission at every wavelength, remove the host galaxy and dust, reconstruct the AGN spectral energy distribution and integrate them to determine the intrinsic emission and the accretion rate. In reality, this is not possible due to observational limitations and our own galaxy line-of-sight obscuration. We have then to infer the bolometric luminosity from spectral measurements made in discontinuous wavebands and at different epochs. In this paper, we tackle this issue by exploring different methods to determine the bolometric luminosity. We first explore the trend of accretion efficiency with black hole mass (ε ∝ M∼0.5) found in recent work by Davis \\&amp; Laor and discuss why this is most likely an artefact of the parameter space covered by their Palomar–Green quasar sample. We then target small samples of AGNs at different redshifts, luminosities and black hole masses to investigate the possible methods to calculate the accretion efficiency. For these sources we are able to determine the mass accretion rate and, with some assumptions, the accretion efficiency distributions. Even though we select the sources for which we are able to determine the parameters more accurately, there are still factors affecting the measurements that are hard to constrain. We suggest methods to overcome these problems based on contemporaneous multiwavelength data measurements and specifically targeted observations for AGNs in different black hole mass ranges.}",
